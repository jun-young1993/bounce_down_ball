# Bounce Down Ball - Flutter Game PRD

## Overview
Bounce Down Ball is a physics-based puzzle/runner game built with Flutter using the Flame game engine. The game features a ball that continuously rolls down a slope while the player controls its horizontal movement through device tilt (mobile) or keyboard input (desktop). Players must avoid obstacles and use bounce pads to gain height, earning points for survival time and successful maneuvers.

## Core Features

### 1. Physics-Based Ball Movement
- Realistic physics simulation using Forge2D (Box2D)
- Ball responds to gravity and rolls down slopes
- Smooth horizontal movement controlled by device tilt or keyboard
- Air resistance and friction for realistic movement

### 2. Obstacle Avoidance System
- Static red obstacles that cause game over on collision
- Dynamic obstacle spawning system
- Increasing difficulty as game progresses
- Visual feedback for collisions

### 3. Bounce Pad Mechanics
- Yellow bounce pads that launch the ball upward
- High restitution physics for enhanced bounce effect
- Strategic placement for gameplay variety
- Visual and audio feedback for successful bounces

### 4. Score and Progress System
- Real-time score tracking based on survival time
- High score persistence
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Achievement system for milestones

### 5. Cross-Platform Controls
- Mobile: Accelerometer-based tilt controls
- Desktop: Keyboard arrow key controls
- Responsive input handling
- Platform-specific optimizations
