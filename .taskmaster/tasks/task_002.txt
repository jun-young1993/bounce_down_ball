# Task ID: 2
# Title: Ball Physics Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement realistic ball physics with gravity, rolling mechanics, and proper collision detection. The ball should respond naturally to forces and roll down slopes.
# Details:
Create Ball component with CircleShape physics body. Configure density, friction, and restitution properties. Implement proper force application for tilt controls.

# Test Strategy:
Test ball movement under gravity, rolling behavior on slopes, and response to applied forces. Verify smooth 60fps performance.
