# Task ID: 6
# Title: Obstacle System Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create static obstacle system with collision detection that causes game over when the ball hits them. Implement visual feedback for obstacles.
# Details:
Create Obstacle component with PolygonShape physics body. Implement collision callbacks for game over logic. Add visual rendering with red color scheme.

# Test Strategy:
Test obstacle collision detection and game over functionality. Verify visual rendering and proper physics behavior.
