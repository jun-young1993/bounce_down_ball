# Task ID: 7
# Title: Bounce Pad Mechanics
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement bounce pad system with enhanced physics for upward ball movement. Create high restitution physics and visual feedback.
# Details:
Create BouncePad component with high restitution physics. Implement collision callbacks for upward force application. Add yellow visual rendering.

# Test Strategy:
Test bounce pad collision and upward force application. Verify enhanced bounce effect and visual feedback.
